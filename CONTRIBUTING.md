### Description
This file outlines the DOs and DON'Ts while you're in my code.

DO
1. follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/)
2. name descriptively, if you can't find the balance, prefer overdescribing to being unclear
3. unit test as much as you can
4. prior to making a Pull Request that is not a draft, ensure that unit tests, linter, build and all github actions' tests that run also pass (I suggest making these pass locally first)
5. include trailing comma, number or whitespace where applicable for new lines (you can see this in this file wink wink)
6. 

DON'T
1. use semi-colons
2. use double-quotes when single-quotes can be used
3. abbreviate
4. leave comments when good naming can be used to describe the code
5. leave whitespace after code on sameline
6.
