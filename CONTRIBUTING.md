### Description
This file outlines the DOs and DON'Ts while you're in my code.

DO
1. follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/)
2. name descriptively, if you can't find the balance, prefer overdescribing to being unclear
3. unit test as much as you can
4. prior to making a Pull Request that is not a draft, ensure that unit tests, linter, build and all github actions' tests that run also pass (I suggest making these pass locally first)
5. include trailing comma, where applicable for new lines
6. include whitespace for new lines at the end of a file

DON'T
1. use semi-colons unless absolutely necessary such as in CSS
2. use double-quotes when single-quotes can be used
3. abbreviate (except for enviornment types such as "dev" or "prod" for example when it is very clear)
4. leave comments when good naming can be used to describe the code
5. leave whitespace after code on sameline
6.
