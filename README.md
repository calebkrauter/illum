# Portfolio Web App (illum)

Get to know me, projects I've developed and my experience as a Software Developer through my digital resume.

## Tech Stack

* **Languages**: TypeScript, CSS
* **Libraries**: React
* **Frameworks**: Next.js
* **Deployment**: Vercel, Github Actions
* **Runtime Environment**: Node.js

## Dependencies

* Node.js
* Next.js
* React
* Typescript

## Getting Started
* `npm install`
* `npm run dev`

## Thought Process
* Typescript is used to ensure security in type safety and good standards while having the versitility of javascript.
* CSS (vanilla) is being used as a learning exercise rather than using Tailwind which I am more familiar with.
* React I am using because I both have famiiliary with it and would like to learn it better. React also works with Next.js and is a modern and popular library.
* Vercel is used as a quick and easy way to get the site deployed and would like to integrate Github Actions as a learning exercise to improve automation.
